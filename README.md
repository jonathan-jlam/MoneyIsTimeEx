# MoneyIsTimeEx

MoneyIsTime! is a Chrome Extension that converts prices on Amazon e-commerce pages into hours you would need to work to earn that amount of money.

Make sense of the money that you spend online by translating price tags into real-life hours of work. It is up to you whether you use this tool as an encouragement or discouragement from spending money online. My simple goal is to give users a new perspective on the relationship between money and time as it relates to shopping.

Try it out by downloading the `build` folder and loading it into Chrome from developer mode.

EASY TO USE:
- After inputting your hourly wage into MoneyIsTime!, begin seeing small highlighted boxes next to price markers on Amazon websites.
- Designed to be non-intrusive to the shopping experience.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY
- MoneyIsTime! only stores data in Chrome local storage for the sole purpose of providing service to users.
- No user data is collected, stored, used, or disclosed externally.

SUPPORT
- Version 0.0.0.1 currently functions only on Amazon webpages.
